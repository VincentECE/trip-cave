# **Projection Mapping Sky Project üåå**

This project brings the **sky indoors** using creative **web technologies** and projection mapping. It allows users to project a dynamic sky onto a ceiling, controlled via a smartphone app. The project highlights the integration of **React**, **Express**, **socket.io**, and **Millumin** with customized hardware for a seamless projection experience.

## **How It Works**

1. **Frontend:** React app serves as the user interface, allowing scene control.
2. **Backend:** Express server handles backend logic and communicates with the projector.
3. **Real-Time Updates:** The **socket.io** library ensures low-latency control between the app and hardware.
4. **Projection Mapping:** Millumin software maps the projected visuals precisely onto the ceiling.
